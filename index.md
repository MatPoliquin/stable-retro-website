A fork of gym-retro ('lets you turn classic video games into Gym environments for reinforcement learning with additional games').
Since gym-retro is in maintenance now and doesn't accept new games, plateforms or bug fixes, you can instead submit PRs with new games or features here in stable-retro: [Github repo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro)


## Installation Ubuntu/Windows/MacOS:
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/stable-retro.git
```
